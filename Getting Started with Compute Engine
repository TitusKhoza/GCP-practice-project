LAB # Google Cloud Fundamentals: Getting Started with Compute Engine.

## Objectives:

In this lab, you will learn how to perform the following taskes:

 - Create a Compute Engine Virtual machine using the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) console.
 - Create a Compute Engine virtual machine using gcloud command-line interface.
 - Connect between the two instances.

 #Steps:
 
 1. Create a Compute Engine virtual machine instance using the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Console.

     gcloud compute instances create my-vm-1 --machine-type "n1-standard-1" --image-project "debian-cloud" --image "debian-9-stretch-v2019213" --subnet "default" --tags http



2. Create a Compute Engine virtual machine using the cloud command-line interface.
   
    gcloud config set/zone us-central1-b

    gcloud compute instances create my-vm-2 --machine-type "n1-standard" --image-project "debian-cloud" --image "debian-9-stretch-v20190213" --subnet "default"


3. Connect between the two instances.

  1. Use the ping command to confirm that ny-vm-2 can reach my-vm-1 over the network:

    - Connect to my-vm-2:

          gcloud compute ssh my-vm-2

    - ping my-vm-1 from my-vm-2:

          ping -c 4 my-vm-1

    - Use the ssh command to open a command prompt on my-vm-1 from my-vm-2:
      
          ssh my-vm-1
          
    - If you are prompted about whether you want to continue connecting to a host with unknown authenticity, enter YES to confirm that you do.

    - At the command prompt on my-vm-1, install the Nginx web server:

          Sudo apt-get install nginx-light -y

    - Use the nano text editor to add a custom massage to the home page of the web server:
    
          sudo nano /var/www/html/index.nginx-debian.html

    - Use the arrow keys to move the cursor to the line just below the h1 header.Add text like this, and replace YOUR_NAME with your name:

          Hi from YOUR NAME

    -  Exit the editor and confirm that the web server is serving your new page. At the command prompt on my-vm-1, execute this command:

          Curl http://localhost

        - Result:The response will be the HTML source of the web server's home page, including your line of custom text.

    - To exit the command prompt on my-vm-1, execute this command:

        Exit

    - To confirm that my-vm-2 can reach the web server on my-vm-1, at the command on my-vm-2, execute this command:

          Curl http://my-vm-1/

 2. - Now get the external IP of my-vm-1 instance from this command:

          gcloud instance list --zone us-central1-a

 3. - Paste the copied IP address of my-vm-1 into a new browser tab and hot enter.

         Result: You will see your web server's home page, including your custom text
